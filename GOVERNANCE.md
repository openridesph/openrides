# OpenRides Governance

## Purpose

OpenRides is an open-source, community-driven ride-hailing and delivery platform designed to be fair, transparent, and accessible.

This governance document defines how decisions are made, how contributors participate, and how the project continues to operate even if the original creator is no longer involved.

The goal is to ensure OpenRides remains:
- Open
- Fair
- Community-driven
- Sustainable
- Independent

# Core Principles

## 1. Open Source First

OpenRides will always remain open source.

The codebase will:
- Remain publicly accessible
- Accept community contributions
- Use a copyleft license (GPLv3)
- Prevent closed-source forks from dominating the ecosystem

---

## 2. Community Ownership

OpenRides is not owned by a single person.

It is maintained by:
- Contributors
- Maintainers
- The community

No single entity should be able to control the project without community involvement.

---

## 3. Transparency

All major decisions must be made publicly.

This includes:
- Feature decisions
- Architectural changes
- Governance changes
- Roadmap changes

Discussions should happen in:
- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Discussions
- Public chat channels

---

## 4. Fair Platform Philosophy

OpenRides exists to:
- Support drivers
- Support passengers
- Reduce excessive platform fees

The platform must not:
- Exploit drivers
- Exploit passengers
- Introduce hidden fees
